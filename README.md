Welcome to My_Smart_Home! I made this based on the codelabs given by google here - 
https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-classes-and-objects?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-basics-compose-unit-2-pathway-1%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-compose-classes-and-objects#10 !

Hope you like it and make something with it!

Also, if you have any suggestions, put them in the 'issues' .
